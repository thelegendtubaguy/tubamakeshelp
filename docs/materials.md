# Our Materials

Here at TubaMakes we utilize a variety of materials that all provide something unique.

## Filament

While most of our store listings currently are resin prints, we do offer some filament models.  These are typically larger pieces like terrain, functional parts, or models specifically designed for filament.  Each listing will state if it is filament and which kind (most often PLA).

### PLA

Polylactic Acid (PLA) is a popular thermoplastic used in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing. Derived from renewable resources like corn starch or sugarcane, PLA is biodegradable under industrial composting conditions, making it one of the more environmentally friendly plastics. Its ease of use, low cost, and wide availability make it an excellent choice for creating detailed, lightweight, and visually appealing models. PLA also offers a smooth surface finish and comes in a variety of vibrant colors and specialty blends, such as silk or glow-in-the-dark options.

However, PLA has some limitations. While it is non-toxic and generally safe to handle, it emits a faint sweet smell when melted, which some individuals might find irritating. It is not suitable for high-strength or high-temperature applications, as it can deform at relatively low temperatures (around 50–60°C). Additionally, while PLA is marketed as biodegradable, it requires specific industrial conditions to break down effectively and does not degrade quickly in typical landfill environments. On the positive side, its plant-based origins and lower carbon footprint compared to petroleum-based plastics make PLA a more sustainable choice for eco-conscious creators.

When handling a PLA-printed model, you should be mindful of its temperature sensitivity and brittleness. PLA is prone to softening or warping if exposed to direct sunlight, high heat, or prolonged contact with hot surfaces, so it’s best to store the model in a cool, shaded location. While PLA is relatively strong for display purposes, it is not as impact-resistant as other materials and may chip or crack under heavy stress or rough handling. If any post-processing is desired, such as painting or sanding, customers should use fine-grit sandpaper to avoid excessive abrasion and work in a well-ventilated area to minimize exposure to airborne particles. For display or decorative use, a protective clear coat can enhance the model's durability and appearance.

### ASA/ABS

Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate (ASA) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) are popular thermoplastics in FDM 3D printing, known for their strength, durability, and weather resistance. ASA is particularly favored for outdoor applications due to its superior UV resistance, while ABS offers excellent impact strength and temperature resistance. Both materials are ideal for functional prototypes, mechanical parts, and items requiring longevity under demanding conditions. Their slightly glossy finish and ability to be smoothed with acetone vapor further enhance their aesthetic and functional appeal.

Despite their benefits, ASA and ABS have notable challenges. Both materials can emit fumes during printing, which may contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and styrene, so proper ventilation is essential in the manufacturing process. Additionally, they can be more challenging to print than PLA, requiring higher temperatures and sometimes an enclosed 3D printer to prevent warping. While they are durable, neither material is biodegradable, making them less environmentally friendly. However, their long-lasting properties and recyclability (if processed correctly) can reduce the need for frequent replacements, contributing to sustainability in some contexts.

Customers receiving ASA or ABS printed models should handle them with care to preserve their finish and structural integrity. These materials are highly durable but can still be scratched or damaged by sharp objects. For models intended for outdoor use, ASA provides exceptional weather resistance, but prolonged exposure to harsh chemicals or abrasives should be avoided. When performing post-processing, such as sanding or painting, customers should work in a well-ventilated space to avoid inhaling any particles or fumes. If acetone smoothing is desired, exercise caution and follow safety guidelines, as acetone is a flammable and hazardous solvent.

## Resin

Resin printing is our bread and butter.  Most of our models, pin-ups, statues, and minis will be printed from photopolymer resin.  Photopolymer resin is a liquid material used in Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing, valued for its ability to produce highly detailed and smooth models. When exposed to UV light, the resin cures into a solid, allowing for precise layer-by-layer construction of intricate designs. This material is ideal for applications requiring fine detail and a high-quality finish, such as miniatures, jewelry prototypes, or dental models. However, uncured resin can be toxic, necessitating the use of gloves and proper ventilation during handling. Once fully cured, the material becomes safe and stable for everyday use, though it remains brittle compared to thermoplastics like PLA or ABS.

### ABS-Like

ABS-like resin is a specialized photopolymer resin designed to mimic the strength, durability, and slight flexibility of ABS plastic, making it an excellent choice for functional prototypes, mechanical parts, and models that need to endure moderate stress. It retains the high precision and smooth surface quality typical of SLA printing while offering improved toughness compared to standard resin. ABS-like resin is also less brittle, providing better impact resistance and durability in finished models. This is our standard resin of choice for producing models that will not only have the best chance of surviving shipping, but also survive being assembled and potentially years of use on the tabletop battlefield.

### Clear

:::info

Clear resin parts are shipped in a cloudy finish as a natural result of the printing process.

:::warning

All clear resin will yellow with enough UV exposure.  We use a "High Clear" resin that is resistant to yellowing, but you must put a UV protective clear coat over any clear resin parts to keep them from yellowing long term.

:::

Clear resin models are shipped in a matte or cloudy finish, a natural result of the printing and curing process. To achieve a glass-like, transparent appearance, customers will need to perform additional post-processing steps. Sanding the surface with progressively finer grits of sandpaper, followed by polishing with a plastic polish or similar compound, will restore clarity and shine. Additionally, applying a clear coat after polishing not only enhances the model’s transparency but also provides essential UV protection to prevent yellowing over time. For best results, work in a clean, well-ventilated area and handle the model gently during each stage to maintain its precision and finish.
