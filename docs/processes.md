# Our Processes

On our quest to bring the digital into the physical, we incorporate several different manufacturing, printing, and finishing methods.

## FDM (Filament) Printing

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a widely used 3D printing technique known for its reliability, affordability, and versatility. This method works by extruding melted thermoplastic filament layer by layer to build up a model, making it suitable for producing functional parts, prototypes, and even decorative items. FDM printers can use various materials, including PLA, ABS, and ASA, allowing for flexibility in strength, durability, and environmental considerations. While FDM printing is excellent for creating sturdy and cost-effective parts, its layer-by-layer construction can result in visible layer lines and may require post-processing for a smoother finish. Despite these minor drawbacks, FDM remains a top choice for both hobbyists and professionals due to its ease of use and scalability.

## SLA (Resin) Printing

If you notice any liquid on your resin printed parts or oozing from them, place them in the sun for a few hours or use a UV light to fully cure them. If any of this liquid comes into contact with your skin, wash the contact area thoroughly as soon as possible.  Uncured resin is **toxic** and can potentially cause an alergic reaction.

Stereolithography (SLA) printing is a high-precision 3D printing technology that uses a laser or UV light to cure liquid photopolymer resin into solid layers, producing exceptionally detailed and smooth models. Known for its ability to capture intricate details and achieve professional-grade finishes, SLA is ideal for applications like miniatures, jewelry, dental models, and prototypes requiring fine resolution. Compared to FDM, SLA offers superior surface quality and accuracy but often involves more complex post-processing, including washing, curing, and additional finishing for optimal results. Despite these extra steps, SLAâ€™s capability to produce detailed, high-quality parts makes it a preferred method for artists, engineers, and manufacturers.

### SLA Post-Processing

After removing resin parts from the printer's build plate, we clean them in two separate baths of 99% Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) for approximately ten minutes. The parts are then dried using either natural evaporation or with the help of a high-powered compressed air blower. Supports are removed from large parts before being washed and from small parts after drying. Once fully dry, the parts are placed on a turntable and exposed to intense UV light for curing. While we make every effort to ensure that parts are completely dry before curing, if any residual IPA remains, it may cause a white powder or dusting on the surface when exposed to UV light. Additionally, in some cases, a small amount of excess resin may remain on the part's surface, leading to a shiny, slightly tacky finish once cured. This is not harmful, and the resin is fully cured, allowing paint to be applied without any issues.
